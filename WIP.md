# WIP — CLI UX workbench implementation

The loop reads THIS file first, does the NEXT ACTION, updates it, reschedules. Be ruthless: ship small
working increments, keep the tree loading, commit often. Autonomous — the user is asleep; make every call,
never wait.

## Loop horizon
Run until ~2026-07-19 04:00 (24h). Each fire: `date` — if past that, do a final commit + write a summary at
the top of the Log + stop the loop (ScheduleWakeup stop:true). Otherwise keep going, reschedule ~300s.

## Goal
Implement the CLI UX redesign (the "workbench") designed in `/home/stachu/code/dark/main/notes/cli-ux/`
(read those deep docs — 01 interaction model, 03A-D component kit, 10-23 views, 90 adjustments ledger, 91
the keymap/badge AUTHORITY). North star for day 1: **`dark` opens on a framed, navigable Tree + Inspect**
instead of a bare prompt.

## Where
- Repo: `/home/stachu/code/dark/loop-fun` (the ACTIVE build dir — data.db is live here).
- Branch: `cli-ux-workbench` off `github/main` (= merged PR #5685 syncing-clean; has conflicts/ops/sync).
- Design docs: `/home/stachu/code/dark/main/notes/cli-ux/` (read-only reference; different dir).
- NEVER force-push, reset --hard, or stash. Commit forward only.

## Inner loop (the tight cycle) — use `./dev-ux-check`
1. Edit a `.dark` (or `.fs`) file.
2. `./dev-ux-check` — reloads packages, greps for load errors, prints PASS/FAIL + the error.
3. If PASS, test: `./scripts/run-cli <cmd>` (or the interactive form via expect if needed).
4. Commit when a unit works: `DARK_ACCOUNT=stachu git commit -am "cli-ux: <what>"`.
- .dark reload ~10s; F# build ~1min (auto via the running `_build-server --watch`).
- GOTCHA: a non-loading .dark aborts the WHOLE reload and can FK-corrupt the package DB. So reload+verify
  after EVERY edit; never stack unverified edits. Recovery: `./scripts/run-cli` still works off last-good
  DB; if corrupted, restore from `rundir/seed.db` or `scripts/build/reset-test-db` (see main memory).
- GOTCHA: Dark type changes need TWO reload passes (embedded package-ref-hashes). Reload twice on type edits.
- Component framework resolves only from a nested submodule under the file's module (see main memory
  `reference_dark_component_resolution`); named fns only in AppState (no inline lambdas persist).

## Build order (from 90 §8) — each phase independently shippable; MainPrompt keeps working throughout
- [x] P1 FRAME — DONE. hstack/distributeCols; SplitPane; Frame (tab bar + breadcrumb + key hints); workbench
      SubApp with Tree|Inspect split (live source pane, Tab focus); `dark` no-args opens it (DARK_CLASSIC=1 =
      classic prompt). Verified on screen via ./dev-drive. Commits 5053e91f4…4a82936cf.
- [ ] P2: Home dashboard + Changes (lift SCM.Review.App into SplitPane) + History (branches/commits/ops).
- [ ] P3: `:` CommandBar (MainPrompt in an overlay) + `/` global search.
- [ ] P4: MultilineEditor → Edit + Scratchpad.
- [ ] P5: Resolve (wire the conflictDispatch seam + conflicts.dark).
- [ ] P6: Mesh, Agents, Runs, Services, Things, Docs.

## Keymap/badge = 91 is authority
x=destroy, d=diff/detail, r=rename-or-rerun; Ctrl+Tab=views/Tab=panes; ?=HelpOverlay; badge set frozen (91 §4).

## NEXT ACTION
P2 — make the workbench a real daily driver. Order (each small, verify with ./dev-drive, commit):
1. DONE ✓ Tree viewport scroll (stateless bottom-anchor: scrollOffset = max 0 (selected-visible+1)). Verified
   in a 14-row window: DOWN×18 into Darklang scrolls, `> Tailscale/` stays visible. (dev-drive now honors
   DEV_DRIVE_ROWS/COLS + shows only the final frame.)
2. DONE ✓ Inspect-pane scroll (detailScroll; focus-aware ↑↓; reset on selection change). Verified: Tab into
   Inspect + ↓×6 scrolls a fn's source, selection unchanged.
3. Wire CHANGES view (activeView=4): when activeView==4, render body = WIP items list (left) | diff (right)
   instead of the tree. Reuse SCM.Review.App helpers: `loadWipItems branchId` → items; select one → its diff
   via the review app's diff builder (or getWip + Stdlib.Diff). SIMPLEST v1: left = list of WIP item names
   (getWipItems / getWipSummary); right = the selected item's current source (same detailLines path by name).
   Empty state: "✓ working tree clean". Add a per-view body dispatch: renderBody matches activeView (0/1 tree,
   4 changes, else coming-soon). Keep it small; the diff can come next. See main/notes/cli-ux/15.
4. Wire HISTORY (activeView=5): commits list from SCM.Log/getCommits (main/notes/cli-ux/16).
5. HOME (activeView=0): real dashboard (main/notes/cli-ux/10).
NOTE: the workbench State currently assumes the tree body. Wiring per-view bodies may want activeView-specific
sub-state later; for v1 keep it simple (compute Changes/History data in render from branchId). Keep tree body
for Home/Tree until Home gets its own.

## Status: P1 COMPLETE ✓ — `dark` opens the framed Tree|Inspect workbench (verified on screen; classic prompt
   behind DARK_CLASSIC=1; with-args commands unaffected). Commits 5053e91f4…4a82936cf. Now on P2.

## Gotchas learned (append as you hit them)
- Typed lambda params are NOT supported: `fun s -> …` only, never `fun (s: String) -> …` (PARSE-UNCLOSED).
- Module-level VALUES use `val name = …` (NO type annotation). `let` is only for functions + local bindings.
  (e.g. `val viewNames = [ … ]`, not `let viewNames : List<String> = …`.)
- Name resolution from `Darklang.Cli.Apps.Workbench.*`: use `UI.Layout.…` (not bare `Layout`) — the ancestor
  chain hits `Darklang.Cli`, from which `UI.Layout` resolves but `Layout` doesn't. `Colors` resolves bare.
- A non-loading .dark aborts the whole reload → always `./dev-ux-check` after each edit; read the real error
  via `grep -niE 'error\\[|Unresolved|expected|not found|not supported' rundir/logs/packages.log | tail`.

## Log (newest first)
- 2026-07-18 04:55 — P2.2: Inspect-pane scroll done (detailScroll, focus-aware ↑↓, reset on selection change).
  Verified via dev-drive (Tab+↓×6 scrolls fn source in Stachu.Parser). Commit 0e30081be. Next: wire Changes view.
- 2026-07-18 04:46 — P2.1: Tree viewport scroll (stateless). Improved dev-drive (final-frame-only capture +
  DEV_DRIVE_ROWS/COLS). Verified scroll in a 14-row window (DOWN×18 → `> Tailscale/` visible, list scrolled).
  Commit 32830eb06. Next: Inspect-pane scroll (P2.2), then wire Changes/History/Home.
- 2026-07-18 04:38 — **P1 COMPLETE**. Flipped `dark` no-args → workbench (core.dark; DARK_CLASSIC=1 = classic).
  Verified all 3: no-args→workbench frame; `status`/with-args still print; DARK_CLASSIC=1→classic prompt.
  Commit 4a82936cf. `dark` now opens the framed, navigable Tree|Inspect workbench. On to P2 (scroll, then wire
  Changes/History/Home).
- 2026-07-18 04:27 — P1: Tree|Inspect body split done (SplitPane in renderBody; renderTreeList + detailLines
  + renderDetail; State.focus; Tab toggles). Verified: split renders both panes; source-fetch path returns
  real List.map source. Commit 601183329. LAST P1 step next: flip `dark` no-args → workbench (keep DARK_CLASSIC).
- 2026-07-18 04:18 — P1: VISUALLY VERIFIED the workbench. Built `./dev-drive` (PTY frame-dump helper; host
  has no expect, run-in-docker too slow). Frame renders correctly (tab bar w/ Tree active, breadcrumb + branch
  + ✓synced, tree body Darklang/Feriel/Stachu, key hints, status bar); ↑↓ + → descend work (→ into Stachu
  lists its submodules). Day-1 north star essentially hit. Commits 42567910a. Next: body split + `dark` flip.
- 2026-07-18 04:09 — P1: workbench SubApp done (app.dark: State/render/handleKey/makeSubApp/execute) + registered
  `workbench`/`wb`. Gotcha: Write dropped ESC bytes in control strings → normalized to  via python. Verified
  help + loadItems root → [Darklang,Feriel,Stachu]. Loads clean. Commit e1cb56823. NOT yet visually verified (TTY).
- 2026-07-18 04:00 — P1: frame.dark done (tab bar + breadcrumb + keyhint render helpers). Learned 2 gotchas
  (val for module values; UI.Layout not Layout from Apps.Workbench). Verified, committing. Next: app.dark SubApp.
- 2026-07-18 03:53 — P1: SplitPane done (ui/splitpane.dark: drawBox focus-aware border, render both
  orientations, narrow-collapse, toggle). Hit + recorded the typed-lambda-param gotcha. Verified, commit
  d957c2471. Re-strategized: ship a `workbench` SubApp (reuse nav) before touching core.dark. Next: the Frame.
- 2026-07-18 03:5x — P1: added hstack/distributeCols/fixedWidth/flexWidth/greedyWidth to ui/layout.dark;
  verified [40,60] split; committed 5053e91f4. Inner loop (./dev-ux-check) green. Next: SplitPane.
- 2026-07-18 03:5x — setup: branched cli-ux-workbench off github/main; loop-fun is the active build dir;
  wrote WIP + dev-ux-check + 5-min loop.
