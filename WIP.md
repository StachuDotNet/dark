# WIP — CLI UX workbench implementation

The loop reads THIS file first, does the NEXT ACTION, updates it, reschedules. Be ruthless: ship small
working increments, keep the tree loading, commit often. Autonomous — the user is asleep; make every call,
never wait.

## Goal
Implement the CLI UX redesign (the "workbench") designed in `/home/stachu/code/dark/main/notes/cli-ux/`
(read those deep docs — 01 interaction model, 03A-D component kit, 10-23 views, 90 adjustments ledger, 91
the keymap/badge AUTHORITY). North star for day 1: **`dark` opens on a framed, navigable Tree + Inspect**
instead of a bare prompt.

## Where
- Repo: `/home/stachu/code/dark/loop-fun` (the ACTIVE build dir — data.db is live here).
- Branch: `cli-ux-workbench` off `github/main` (= merged PR #5685 syncing-clean; has conflicts/ops/sync).
- Design docs: `/home/stachu/code/dark/main/notes/cli-ux/` (read-only reference; different dir).
- NEVER force-push, reset --hard, or stash. Commit forward only.

## Inner loop (the tight cycle) — use `./dev-ux-check`
1. Edit a `.dark` (or `.fs`) file.
2. `./dev-ux-check` — reloads packages, greps for load errors, prints PASS/FAIL + the error.
3. If PASS, test: `./scripts/run-cli <cmd>` (or the interactive form via expect if needed).
4. Commit when a unit works: `DARK_ACCOUNT=stachu git commit -am "cli-ux: <what>"`.
- .dark reload ~10s; F# build ~1min (auto via the running `_build-server --watch`).
- GOTCHA: a non-loading .dark aborts the WHOLE reload and can FK-corrupt the package DB. So reload+verify
  after EVERY edit; never stack unverified edits. Recovery: `./scripts/run-cli` still works off last-good
  DB; if corrupted, restore from `rundir/seed.db` or `scripts/build/reset-test-db` (see main memory).
- GOTCHA: Dark type changes need TWO reload passes (embedded package-ref-hashes). Reload twice on type edits.
- Component framework resolves only from a nested submodule under the file's module (see main memory
  `reference_dark_component_resolution`); named fns only in AppState (no inline lambdas persist).

## Build order (from 90 §8) — each phase independently shippable; MainPrompt keeps working throughout
- [ ] P1 FRAME: `hstack`+`distributeCols` in ui/layout.dark → `SplitPane` → the Frame (TabBar+Breadcrumb+
      StatusBar/Signals+KeyHintBar) → mount a `TreeWidget` (extract from navInteractive+tree) → `dark` opens
      on framed Tree. Add Inspect. (readKey timeout for live ticks can come later — P1 is static-navigable.)
- [ ] P2: Home dashboard + Changes (lift SCM.Review.App into SplitPane) + History (branches/commits/ops).
- [ ] P3: `:` CommandBar (MainPrompt in an overlay) + `/` global search.
- [ ] P4: MultilineEditor → Edit + Scratchpad.
- [ ] P5: Resolve (wire the conflictDispatch seam + conflicts.dark).
- [ ] P6: Mesh, Agents, Runs, Services, Things, Docs.

## Keymap/badge = 91 is authority
x=destroy, d=diff/detail, r=rename-or-rerun; Ctrl+Tab=views/Tab=panes; ?=HelpOverlay; badge set frozen (91 §4).

## NEXT ACTION
Start P1 step 1: add `hstack` + `distributeCols` to `packages/darklang/cli/ui/layout.dark` (mirror of
vstack/distributeRows). Reload, verify it loads, eval a tiny layout to confirm. Then SplitPane.

## Status: not started (setup done: branch + WIP + inner-loop helper)

## Log (newest first)
- 2026-07-18 03:5x — setup: branched cli-ux-workbench off github/main in loop-fun; confirmed loop-fun is the
  active build dir; wrote WIP + dev-ux-check + the 5-min loop. Next: hstack in ui/layout.dark.
