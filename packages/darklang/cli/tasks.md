## More Misc.
- [ ] the old terminal.dark used to have a calculateWrappedLineCount fn but now we don't - don't we need that for anything?


## Tidy CLI Experiments

- [ ] let's remove some of the redundant demos; do reasonable research, then _recommend_ consolidation efforts. the goal here is to have _less_ code, by way of removing redundant demos, components, etc.
- [ ] that said, if any component exists but is un-demo'd, we should fix that by adding it where relevant
- [ ] follow through after asking me how I'd like to proceed
