- [x] Create UI mockups and interface designs

### Phase 4: Implementation Planning âœ…
- [x] Sketch F# type definitions and module structure
- [x] Plan database schema and sync protocol
- [x] Create phased development roadmap
- [x] Identify technical risks and mitigations
- [x] Define success criteria and testing approach

### Phase 5: Meeting Preparation âœ…
- [x] Create executive summary for advisor meeting
- [x] Prepare demo script with fallback options

- [ ] Build simple sync server
- [ ] Add session persistence
- [ ] Test with two developers

### Phase 2 Implementation (4 weeks)
- [ ] VS Code extension integration  
- [ ] Advanced conflict resolution
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Documentation and testing
