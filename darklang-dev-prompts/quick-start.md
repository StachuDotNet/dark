# Quick Start: Darklang Dev Experience Work

## Immediate Next Steps

You're helping design Darklang's developer experience. I need concrete artifacts for a meeting Sunday.

**Start here**: Read `01-research-context.md` and begin the research phase.

## Key Points
- I'm stuck in analysis paralysis - help me make progress
- Main goal: Let two developers (me + coworker) share code
- Time pressure: Meetings tomorrow (coworker) and Sunday (advisor)
- Start simple: Focus on "boring patches" like adding one function

## Before Making Big Decisions, Ask Me About:
- Core architecture choices
- Database design decisions
- Sync protocol complexity
- Which flows to prioritize first
- CLI vs VS Code development focus

## Work Through Phases Sequentially:
1. **Research** (01) - Understand current state
2. **Concepts** (02) - Design architecture  
3. **Flows** (03) - Document user experience
4. **Implementation** (04) - Plan code changes
5. **Meetings** (05) - Prepare deliverables

## Remember:
- Update `../TODOs.md` as you progress
- Create concrete artifacts, don't just plan
- Progress > perfection
- Focus on what would actually help developers collaborate

**Start with Phase 1 research and build from there.**
