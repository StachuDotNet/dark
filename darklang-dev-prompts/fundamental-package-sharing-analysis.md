# The Fundamental Question: How to Actually Share & Collaborate on Darklang Code

*Getting to the core issue: enabling real parallel development between coworkers*

## 🎯 **The Actual Problem**

You and your coworker want to:
1. **Work on the same codebase** in parallel
2. **Share changes** without overwriting each other
3. **Merge work** when both of you modify the same thing
4. **Have a single source of truth** that both can access

This is fundamentally about **package sharing and merging**, not fancy collaboration features.

## 🔍 **Current State Analysis**

### **What Darklang Has Today**

Based on the codebase and our exploration:

1. **Packages exist** - Can create and organize code into packages
2. **Package content** - Functions, types, handlers can be defined
3. **Some form of storage** - Packages are persisted somewhere
4. **Basic operations** - Can likely create, read, maybe update packages

### **What's Probably Missing (The Real Blockers)**

1. **No version control** - Can't track changes over time
2. **No branching** - Can't work on separate copies then merge
3. **No diff/merge** - Can't see what changed or combine changes
4. **No shared repository** - No central place both developers can access
5. **No conflict detection** - System doesn't know when you both changed the same thing

---

## 💡 **The Minimum Viable Solution**

### **Core Requirements for Parallel Development**

**Absolute Minimum:**
1. **Shared package repository** - A place both devs can push/pull from
2. **Change tracking** - Know what changed and who changed it
3. **Basic merging** - Combine non-conflicting changes automatically
4. **Conflict detection** - Alert when both changed the same thing
5. **Manual conflict resolution** - Let humans decide what to keep

### **What We DON'T Need (Yet)**
- Real-time collaboration
- AI assistance
- VR environments
- Mobile support
- Advanced security
- Performance monitoring

## 🛠️ **Simplest Possible Implementation**

### **Option 1: Git-Style Package Versioning**

**How it would work:**

```bash
# Developer A starts work
darklang package clone SharedProject
darklang package branch feature-a
# Makes changes to functions...
darklang package commit "Add user authentication"
darklang package push

# Developer B works in parallel
darklang package clone SharedProject  
darklang package branch feature-b
# Makes different changes...
darklang package commit "Add payment processing"
darklang package push

# Merge back together
darklang package checkout main
darklang package merge feature-a  # Clean merge
darklang package merge feature-b  # Might have conflicts
```

**Package changes stored as patches:**
```darklang
// .darklang/patches/2024-01-15-1234.patch
patch {
  package = "SharedProject"
  timestamp = "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
  author = "developer-a"
  message = "Add user authentication"
  
  changes = [
    {
      type = "add_function"
      path = "functions/authenticate"
      content = "let authenticate (username: String) (password: String) : Bool = ..."
    }
    {
      type = "modify_type"
      path = "types/User"
      before = "type User = { id: String; name: String }"
      after = "type User = { id: String; name: String; passwordHash: String }"
    }
  ]
}
```

### **Option 2: Simple Lock-Based Editing**

**Even simpler - pessimistic locking:**

```bash
# Developer A locks a function for editing
darklang package lock SharedProject/functions/processPayment
# Now only Dev A can edit this function

# Developer B tries to edit same function
darklang package lock SharedProject/functions/processPayment
# ERROR: Function locked by developer-a (locked 5 minutes ago)

# Developer B works on different function instead
darklang package lock SharedProject/functions/sendEmail
# SUCCESS: Lock acquired

# When done, release locks
darklang package unlock SharedProject/functions/processPayment
darklang package unlock SharedProject/functions/sendEmail
```

**Benefits:**
- No merge conflicts ever
- Very simple to implement
- Clear who's working on what

**Drawbacks:**
- Can't work on same function simultaneously
- Requires discipline to release locks
- Less flexible than branching

### **Option 3: Function-Level Versioning**

**Each function/type is versioned independently:**

```bash
# Developer A modifies authenticate function
darklang function edit SharedProject/authenticate
# Creates version authenticate@v2

# Developer B also modifies authenticate function  
darklang function edit SharedProject/authenticate
# Creates version authenticate@v3

# Package now has multiple versions
SharedProject/
  functions/
    authenticate@v1  (original)
    authenticate@v2  (dev A's version)
    authenticate@v3  (dev B's version)
    authenticate@active -> v1  (what's currently active)

# Choose which version to make active
darklang function activate SharedProject/authenticate@v2

# Or merge versions
darklang function merge SharedProject/authenticate@v2 SharedProject/authenticate@v3
# Opens merge tool to combine changes
```

## 🎯 **Recommended First Step: Hybrid Approach**

### **Start with Lock-Based + Function Versioning**

**Phase 1: Basic Locking (Week 1)**
```bash
# Simple locking to prevent overwrites
darklang package work-on SharedProject/functions/authenticate
# Acquires lock, downloads latest version

darklang package save
# Saves changes, releases lock
```

**Phase 2: Add Simple Versioning (Week 2)**
```bash
# Save your work as a version without locking others out
darklang package checkpoint "Add validation logic"
# Creates a checkpoint others can see but doesn't change active version

# Review checkpoints
darklang package checkpoints list
# v1: Initial version (main)
# v2: Add validation logic (developer-a) 
# v3: Fix security issue (developer-b)

# Promote checkpoint to main
darklang package checkpoint promote v2
```

**Phase 3: Basic Merging (Week 3)**
```bash
# See differences
darklang package diff v2 v3

# Simple merge
darklang package merge v3
# AUTO-MERGE: Changes to different functions merged automatically
# CONFLICT: Both modified functions/authenticate
#   Use 'darklang package resolve' to fix conflicts
```

## 🔧 **Minimal Technical Requirements**

### **Backend Storage**

```sql
-- Simplest possible version tracking
CREATE TABLE package_versions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  package_name TEXT,
  version_number INTEGER,
  parent_version UUID,  -- For tracking lineage
  author TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP,
  message TEXT,
  is_active BOOLEAN,
  content JSONB  -- The actual package data
);

CREATE TABLE package_locks (
  package_name TEXT,
  item_path TEXT,  -- e.g. "functions/authenticate"
  locked_by TEXT,
  locked_at TIMESTAMP,
  PRIMARY KEY (package_name, item_path)
);
```

### **Package Content Structure**

```json
{
  "package": "SharedProject",
  "version": 2,
  "parent_version": 1,
  "types": {
    "User": {
      "content": "type User = { id: String; name: String }",
      "checksum": "abc123",
      "last_modified_by": "developer-a"
    }
  },
  "functions": {
    "authenticate": {
      "content": "let authenticate (user: String) (pass: String) : Bool = ...",
      "checksum": "def456",
      "last_modified_by": "developer-b"
    }
  }
}
```

### **Conflict Detection**

```darklang
let detectConflicts (base: PackageVersion) (versionA: PackageVersion) (versionB: PackageVersion) : List<Conflict> =
  let conflicts = []
  
  // Check each function
  for funcName in getAllFunctionNames base versionA versionB do
    let baseFunc = base.functions[funcName]
    let funcA = versionA.functions[funcName]
    let funcB = versionB.functions[funcName]
    
    if funcA.checksum != baseFunc.checksum && funcB.checksum != baseFunc.checksum then
      // Both modified the same function
      conflicts.add {
        type = "function_conflict"
        path = $"functions/{funcName}"
        baseVersion = baseFunc
        versionA = funcA
        versionB = funcB
      }
  
  conflicts
```

## 🚀 **Implementation Roadmap**

### **Week 1: Basic Package Sharing**
```bash
# Can push/pull packages to shared repository
darklang package push SharedProject
darklang package pull SharedProject
```

### **Week 2: Change Tracking**
```bash
# See what changed
darklang package status
# Modified: functions/authenticate
# Added: functions/validateUser
# Deleted: functions/oldFunction

darklang package diff
# Shows actual changes line by line
```

### **Week 3: Simple Locking**
```bash
# Prevent overwrites
darklang package lock functions/authenticate
darklang package unlock functions/authenticate
darklang package locks list
```

### **Week 4: Basic Versioning**
```bash
# Create versions
darklang package commit "My changes"
darklang package history
darklang package revert v3
```

### **Week 5: Conflict Detection**
```bash
# Detect when both changed same thing
darklang package merge other-version
# CONFLICT in functions/authenticate
```

### **Week 6: Manual Merge Resolution**
```bash
# Resolve conflicts
darklang package resolve
# Opens simple merge tool
```

## ✅ **Success Metrics**

**After 6 weeks, you and your coworker can:**

1. ✅ **Work on same package** without overwriting each other
2. ✅ **See what the other person changed**
3. ✅ **Merge changes** when working on different functions
4. ✅ **Resolve conflicts** when both edit same function
5. ✅ **Track history** of who changed what when

**What this enables:**
- Real parallel development
- No more "who has the latest version?"
- Basic collaboration without complexity
- Foundation for more advanced features later

---

## 🎯 **The Simplest Next Step**

**Tomorrow's TODO:**

1. Add a `package_versions` table to store versions
2. Implement `darklang package push` to save current state
3. Implement `darklang package pull` to get latest version
4. Add simple locking: `darklang package lock [item]`
5. Basic diff: Compare two versions and show changes

This is **10x simpler** than what I designed before, but it would actually solve your real problem: **enabling you and your coworker to write and share Darklang code without stepping on each other's toes**.
