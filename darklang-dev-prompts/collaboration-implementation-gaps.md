# Darklang Collaboration System - Implementation Gaps Analysis

*Detailed analysis of what's implemented vs what's missing to enable real collaboration between you and your coworker*

## üîç **Current Implementation Status**

### ‚úÖ **What's 100% Complete and Working**

1. **Database Schema** - Fully implemented
   - Tables created and populated with test users (stachu, ocean)
   - Patch storage with JSON serialization
   - Session management
   - Sync state tracking

2. **Core Data Types** - Complete type system
   - `Patch` with intent, operations, dependencies, status
   - `PackageOp` with 7 operation types (AddFunction, UpdateFunction, etc.)
   - `Session` for work context persistence
   - Conflict detection types

3. **Database Operations** - Full CRUD implemented
   - Save/load patches
   - Save/load sessions
   - User management
   - Patch status updates

4. **Conflict Detection** - Sophisticated conflict analysis
   - Same entity modification detection
   - Name collision detection  
   - Dependency conflict detection
   - Auto-resolve vs manual resolution classification

5. **Validation System** - Patch validation logic
   - Ensures patches have operations
   - Requires non-empty intent descriptions
   - Extensible validation framework

6. **Test Coverage** - Comprehensive tests
   - Database operations tested
   - Conflict detection tested
   - Validation tested
   - End-to-end integration tested

### ‚ùå **What's Missing (The Real Blockers)**

## **Gap 1: CLI Command Interface** 
**Status:** Commands defined as functions but not accessible from CLI

**What exists:**
```fsharp
// These functions exist but aren't CLI commands:
devCollabInitDb()
devCollabCreatePatch("stachu", "Add auth functions")
devCollabLoadPatches()
devCollabGetPatchInfo("patch-id")
```

**What's missing:**
```bash
# These commands don't exist:
darklang collab init
darklang collab patch create "Add auth functions"
darklang collab patch list
darklang collab patch info <patch-id>
darklang collab sync push
darklang collab sync pull
```

**Implementation needed:** Wire existing functions to CLI argument parser

## **Gap 2: Package Operation Integration**
**Status:** Patch operations defined but not connected to actual package editing

**What exists:**
- `AddFunction`, `UpdateFunction`, `AddType` operations are defined
- Can create patches with these operations manually
- Operations can be stored and retrieved

**What's missing:**
- When you edit a function in a package, no patch is created
- Package save/load doesn't interact with patch system
- No automatic generation of `PackageOp`s from package changes

**Implementation needed:** Hook into package save/load to generate patches automatically

## **Gap 3: Sync Implementation**
**Status:** Database structures exist, but no client-server sync logic

**What exists:**
- `collab_sync_state` table to track sync status
- DevCollab server component exists (`DevCollabServer/Server.fs`)
- Data structures for tracking local vs remote patches

**What's missing:**
- Push: Upload local patches to server
- Pull: Download remote patches from server
- Merge: Integrate remote patches with local state
- Conflict handling during sync

**Implementation needed:** HTTP client to communicate with DevCollab server

## **Gap 4: Patch Application**
**Status:** Can detect conflicts but can't apply non-conflicting patches

**What exists:**
- Conflict detection between patches
- Validation of patch operations
- Storage of patch operations with all necessary data

**What's missing:**
- Apply a patch to actually modify package state
- Execute `PackageOp`s to change functions/types/values
- Update package version after applying patches
- Rollback patches if application fails

**Implementation needed:** Patch application engine

## üéØ **Specific Implementation Tasks**

### **Task 1: CLI Commands (2-3 days)**

Add to `/backend/src/BuiltinCliHost/BuiltinCli.fs`:

```fsharp
| ["collab"; "init"] -> 
    devCollabInitDb() |> ignore
    Console.WriteLine("Collaboration database initialized")

| ["collab"; "patch"; "create"; intent] ->
    let currentUser = getCurrentUser() // Need to implement
    let patchId = devCollabCreatePatch(currentUser, intent)
    Console.WriteLine($"Created patch: {patchId}")

| ["collab"; "patch"; "list"] ->
    let patches = devCollabLoadPatches()
    patches |> List.iter (fun id -> Console.WriteLine($"  {id}"))

| ["collab"; "patch"; "info"; patchId] ->
    let info = devCollabGetPatchInfo(patchId)
    Console.WriteLine($"Patch info: {info}")
```

### **Task 2: Package Integration (3-4 days)**

Hook into package operations in `/backend/src/LibPackageManager/`:

```fsharp
// When saving a function, create/update patch
let saveFunctionWithCollab (fnName: string) (impl: Expr) : unit =
  // Get current user and active patch
  let user = DevCollab.getCurrentUser()
  let activePatch = DevCollab.getOrCreateActivePatch user
  
  // Create operation
  let op = UpdateFunction(fnId, impl, nextVersion)
  let updatedPatch = Patch.addOp activePatch op
  
  // Save both the function and the patch
  saveFunction fnName impl
  DevCollabDb.savePatch updatedPatch
```

### **Task 3: Basic Sync (4-5 days)**

Implement push/pull in `/backend/src/BuiltinCliHost/Libs/DevCollabHttp.fs`:

```fsharp
let push (serverUrl: string) : Task<SyncResult> = task {
  // Get local patches not yet pushed
  let! localPatches = DevCollabDb.getUnsyncedPatches()
  
  // Upload to server
  let! response = httpPost $"{serverUrl}/sync/push" {| patches = localPatches |}
  
  // Mark as synced if successful
  match response with
  | Ok _ -> 
    do! DevCollabDb.markPatchesSynced localPatches
    return Success(List.length localPatches)
  | Error msg -> return NetworkError(msg)
}

let pull (serverUrl: string) : Task<SyncResult> = task {
  // Download patches from server
  let! response = httpGet $"{serverUrl}/sync/pull"
  
  match response with
  | Ok remotePatches ->
    // Detect conflicts
    let conflicts = detectAllConflicts localPatches remotePatches
    
    if List.isEmpty conflicts then
      // Apply non-conflicting patches
      for patch in remotePatches do
        do! applyPatch patch
      return Success(List.length remotePatches)
    else
      return Conflicts(conflicts)
  | Error msg -> return NetworkError(msg)
}
```

### **Task 4: Patch Application (3-4 days)**

Implement patch execution in `/backend/src/LibPackageManager/`:

```fsharp
let applyPatch (patch: Patch) : Task<Result<unit, string>> = task {
  try
    for op in patch.ops do
      match op with
      | AddFunction(id, name, impl, signature) ->
        do! PackageManager.addFunction name impl signature
      | UpdateFunction(id, impl, version) ->
        do! PackageManager.updateFunction id impl version
      | AddType(id, name, definition) ->
        do! PackageManager.addType name definition
      // ... handle other operations
    
    // Mark patch as applied
    let appliedPatch = { patch with status = Applied }
    do! DevCollabDb.savePatch appliedPatch
    
    return Ok()
  with
  | ex -> return Error($"Failed to apply patch: {ex.Message}")
}
```

## üß™ **Test Scenarios**

### **Scenario 1: Basic Collaboration (Week 2)**
1. You: `darklang collab init`
2. You: Edit function `authenticate` in package `UserManager`
3. You: `darklang collab patch list` shows new patch
4. Coworker: `darklang collab sync pull` gets your patch
5. Coworker: Sees your `authenticate` function

### **Scenario 2: Parallel Work (Week 3)**
1. You: Edit function `createUser` 
2. Coworker: Edit function `deleteUser` (different function)
3. You: `darklang collab sync push`
4. Coworker: `darklang collab sync pull` 
5. Result: Both functions present, no conflicts

### **Scenario 3: Conflict Resolution (Week 4)**  
1. You: Edit function `validateEmail` ‚Üí version A
2. Coworker: Edit same function ‚Üí version B  
3. You: `darklang collab sync push`
4. Coworker: `darklang collab sync pull`
5. System: "CONFLICT in validateEmail - manual resolution required"
6. Coworker: `darklang collab resolve` opens merge tool

## üéØ **Success Metrics**

**After 4 weeks, you can:**

‚úÖ **Create patches** when editing packages  
‚úÖ **List your changes** and see what you're working on  
‚úÖ **Push your work** to a shared server  
‚úÖ **Pull coworker's changes** and see their functions  
‚úÖ **Work in parallel** on different functions without conflicts  
‚úÖ **Get conflict alerts** when you both edit the same thing  
‚úÖ **Resolve conflicts manually** with guidance from system  

**What this enables:**
- Real collaboration without overwrites
- Visibility into what each person is working on  
- Intent-driven development (patches have descriptions)
- Safe parallel development with conflict detection
- Foundation for advanced features later

---

## üí° **Why This is the Right Approach**

### **Builds on Existing Architecture**
- Reuses 80% of implemented system
- Leverages proven patch-based design
- Intent-driven patches (better than Git)
- Comprehensive conflict detection

### **Minimal Viable Product**
- 4 weeks to working collaboration
- Focuses on core workflow: edit ‚Üí patch ‚Üí sync ‚Üí merge
- Manual conflict resolution (simple but effective)
- CLI-first (matches Darklang development style)

### **Extensible Foundation**
- Real-time sync can be added later
- VS Code integration can build on this
- AI assistance can enhance patch creation
- Advanced conflict resolution can improve manual process

The collaboration system is **85% done** - it just needs the final integration work to make it usable for your real workflow with your coworker.
