# Phase 5: Meeting Preparation & Deliverables

## The Goal
You need to help me prepare concrete artifacts for two critical meetings:
- **Tomorrow**: Coworker discussion
- **Sunday**: Advisor presentation

## For Tomorrow's Coworker Meeting

### Key Deliverables
1. **Research Summary**: What we learned about current state
2. **Core Concept Sketches**: Types and architecture outline  
3. **One Working Flow**: Even if minimal, something concrete
4. **Open Questions List**: What we need to decide together
5. **Next Steps Plan**: What to work on next

### Discussion Focus
- Is this the right direction?
- What should we prioritize?
- How do we split the work?
- What are the biggest risks?

## For Sunday's Advisor Meeting

### Presentation Structure
1. **Problem Statement**: Why we need this foundation
2. **Current State**: What we have vs what's missing
3. **Proposed Solution**: Architecture and key concepts
4. **Demo**: Something working (even tiny)
5. **Timeline**: Realistic next steps

### Demo Ideas
- Basic patch creation and sharing
- CLI showing current state
- Simple sync between two instances
- Maybe: Easy MCP server (like old Slack bot)

## Artifacts to Create

### 1. Executive Summary
- 1-page overview of the problem and solution
- Key insights from research
- Recommended approach

### 2. Technical Architecture Document
- Core types and concepts
- System interactions
- Database and sync design

### 3. Developer Experience Specifications
- Key user flows documented
- UI/UX considerations
- Environment integration plans

### 4. Implementation Roadmap
- Phases with timelines
- Dependencies and risks
- Resource requirements

### 5. Working Prototype
- Even minimal, but demonstrates key concepts
- Could be as simple as creating and viewing a patch
- Should show the basic collaboration flow

## Blog Post Draft

### "How Darklang Will Work"
- High-level but informed
- In your voice/style (from blog.darklang.com posts)
- Cover developer experience vision
- Don't need to publish, just for clarity of thinking

### Key Messages
- Why traditional SCM doesn't fit Darklang
- How our approach enables better collaboration  
- Vision for AI-assisted development
- Path from here to production

## Website Planning

### dev.darklang.com Structure
- `/flows` - documented workflows
- `/glossary` - key terms and concepts
- `/patches/[id]` - patch viewer
- `/compare/main...feature` - diff viewer
- `/todos` - community input requests

### Content Strategy
- Pull from Darklang Dev vault
- Similar structure to wip.darklang.com
- Focus on developer engagement

## Your Meeting Prep Tasks

1. **Create presentation outline** for advisor meeting
2. **Prepare demo script** (what to show, how)
3. **List open questions** for both meetings
4. **Draft key documents** (executive summary, technical doc)
5. **Identify follow-up tasks** based on meeting outcomes

## Key Messages to Convey

### To Coworker
- "Here's what I learned and what I think we should build"
- "These are the key decisions we need to make"
- "This is how we could split the work"

### To Advisor  
- "We have a clear path forward"
- "Here's a working demonstration of key concepts"
- "These are realistic next steps with timelines"

## Success Criteria

### For Tomorrow
- Coworker understands the vision
- We have agreement on general direction
- Clear next steps identified
- Work can be divided effectively

### For Sunday
- Advisor sees concrete progress
- Architecture makes sense
- Timeline is realistic
- I appear prepared and thoughtful

## Special Considerations

### Anxiety Management
- Focus on progress made, not perfection
- Have backup plans if demos don't work
- Emphasize learning and iteration

### Voice & Tone
- Honest about challenges
- Excited about possibilities  
- Technically informed but accessible
- Based on blog.darklang.com style

## Output Requirements

Create meeting-ready materials:
- Presentation slides or outline
- Demo scripts with fallbacks
- Question lists for discussion
- Summary documents
- Next steps roadmap

**Remember**: The goal is progress and communication, not perfection. Show thoughtful analysis and concrete next steps.
