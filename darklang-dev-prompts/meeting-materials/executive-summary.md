# Executive Summary: Darklang Developer Collaboration

## The Problem
Darklang has evolved from a browser-based editor to a CLI and file-based development model, but lacks the critical infrastructure for developers to collaborate. We have a language, execution engine, and package manager, but no way for two developers to share code changes.

## Current State
**What Works:**
- Self-hosted CLI with package navigation
- Function-level package management  
- VS Code extension with LSP support
- Automatic build system

**Critical Gap:**
No source control or collaboration mechanism. Each developer works in isolation with no way to share patches, track changes, or merge work.

## Proposed Solution
A minimal patch-based collaboration system that enables two developers to share code:

### Core Concepts
- **Ops**: Atomic operations (AddFunction, UpdateType, etc.)
- **Patches**: Collections of ops representing logical changes
- **Sessions**: Work contexts that persist across CLI restarts
- **Sync**: Simple protocol for sharing patches between developers

### Implementation Approach
1. **Phase 1** (Immediate): Basic patch creation and manual sharing
2. **Phase 2** (This week): Validation and conflict detection
3. **Phase 3** (Next week): VS Code integration and polish
4. **Phase 4** (Future): AI integration and community features

## Key Insight
We don't need full git-like complexity. Start with "boring patches" (adding a single function) and build from there. Focus on the developer experience of writing and sharing code, not complex merge scenarios.

## Demonstration
A working flow where:
1. Developer A creates a new List.filterMap function
2. Creates a patch with this change
3. Shares patch with Developer B
4. Developer B applies patch and uses the function

## Timeline
- **Today**: Core types and basic CLI commands
- **Tomorrow**: Demo with coworker, gather feedback
- **Sunday**: Present to advisor with working prototype
- **Next Week**: Implement validation and conflict detection
- **Two Weeks**: VS Code integration and documentation

## Resources Needed
- 2 developers (me + coworker)
- 2 weeks of focused development
- Simple server for patch storage
- Feedback from early users

## Success Metrics
- Two developers can share code changes
- Patches apply cleanly without conflicts
- CLI maintains state across sessions
- Basic conflict detection works

This approach gets us unstuck and provides a foundation for the full Darklang vision while solving the immediate collaboration problem.
