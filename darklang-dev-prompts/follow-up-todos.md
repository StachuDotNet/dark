- [ ] Add per-patch testing capabilities
- [ ] Implement test viewing and running in VS Code
- [ ] Create test result visualization in conflict resolution
- [ ] Enable testing of patches before merge
- [ ] Add regression testing for patch validation

### 7. **Enhanced Sync Protocol**
- [ ] Implement direct peer-to-peer patch sharing
- [ ] Add selective sync rules (local-only patches)
- [ ] Create offline-ready development mode
- [ ] Implement patch dependencies and merge ordering
- [ ] Add sync conflict detection and resolution

### 8. **Developer Portal (dev.darklang.com)**
- [ ] Create comprehensive flow documentation
- [ ] Build interactive glossary of terms
- [ ] Implement issue tracking (/bugs, /features, /facets)
- [ ] Add user experience documentation with examples
- [ ] Create contribution guidelines and onboarding

## ðŸ“± Lower Priority (Advanced Features)

### 9. **Enhanced VS Code Integration**
- [ ] Add WebView panels for custom package visualization
- [ ] Implement SCM provider with branch visualization
- [ ] Create patch review interface in editor
- [ ] Add real-time collaboration indicators
- [ ] Implement MCP client integration for agents

### 10. **Values vs Globals Distinction**
- [ ] Model different sync mechanisms for different data types
- [ ] Implement "Globals" that have refactor expressions applied
- [ ] Create migration system for value transformations
- [ ] Add validation for value dependencies
- [ ] Design versioning strategy for different data types

### 11. **Tracing System Integration**
- [ ] Revive tracing capabilities for session context
- [ ] Add real-time trace viewing in editors
- [ ] Implement trace analysis for patch validation
- [ ] Create trace-based debugging workflows
- [ ] Add performance profiling per patch

### 12. **Package Search and Discovery**
- [ ] Implement fast keyboard-driven package exploration
- [ ] Add dependency tracking both directions
- [ ] Create package dependency visualization
- [ ] Implement semantic search across package items
- [ ] Add package recommendation system

## ðŸŽ¨ Polish & UX (As Time Allows)

### 13. **Multi-View Support**
- [ ] Enable viewing AST, pretty-printed, and runtime forms
- [ ] Add custom syntax highlighting per package item
- [ ] Implement custom pretty-printing rules
- [ ] Create contextual code navigation
- [ ] Add "focus modes" for different development tasks

### 14. **Advanced Editor Features**
- [ ] Implement CodeLens for patch information
- [ ] Add hover information for package items
- [ ] Create jump-to-definition across packages
- [ ] Implement find-all-references functionality
- [ ] Add refactoring tools for package reorganization

### 15. **Website Integration**
- [ ] Port darklang.com to Darklang itself as demo
- [ ] Create matter.darklang.com for live package browsing
- [ ] Add patch comparison and review interfaces
- [ ] Implement public package sharing
- [ ] Create community contribution workflows

## ðŸš¨ Immediate Next Steps (For Upcoming Meetings)

### Tomorrow's Coworker Meeting Focus:
1. **Enhanced Package Management** - Show hash-based references design
2. **Session Transfer** - Demonstrate session persistence architecture
3. **Virtual File System** - Present VS Code integration plan

### Sunday's Advisor Meeting Focus:
1. **Developer Portal Vision** - Present dev.darklang.com concept
2. **AI Integration Strategy** - Show multi-session agent workflows
3. **Community Contribution** - Demonstrate public collaboration model

## ðŸ’¡ Key Insights from Brain Dump

### Core Problems to Solve:
- **Analysis Paralysis**: Need concrete, testable implementations
- **Two-Developer Workflow**: Focus on stachu + ocean collaboration first  
- **AI Development Limitations**: Enable parallel feature development
- **Editor Flexibility**: Support multiple development environments

### Design Principles to Maintain:
- **Server-First**: Keep logic in F#/Darklang, minimal client complexity
- **Editor Agnostic**: Standard protocols that work everywhere
- **Incremental**: Build on existing CLI/LSP foundation
- **Safe Collaboration**: Manual review, conflict detection, rollback support

### Success Criteria:
- Two developers can share code seamlessly
- AI agents can work on multiple features simultaneously  
- Sessions persist and transfer between machines
- Conflicts are detected and resolved interactively
- The system scales to team and community use
