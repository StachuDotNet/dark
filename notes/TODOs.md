## ðŸ’¡ Key Insights from Brain Dump

### Design Principles to Maintain:
- **Server-First**: Keep logic in F#/Darklang, minimal client complexity
- **Editor Agnostic**: Standard protocols that work everywhere
- **Incremental**: Build on existing CLI/LSP foundation
- **Safe Collaboration**: Manual review; conflict detection, resolution
