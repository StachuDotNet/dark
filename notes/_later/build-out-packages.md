# start to build out an extensive package repository

(AI agents to build out all this stuff)

even if it feels too low level

don't push out to libraries

e.g.
    SMTP servers
    URL stuff
    anything in old ApiServer
    anything in the old PM

"build library" as a flow someone can very quickly trigger in the UI (custom view, or something)

don't rely on vs code 'default' stuff like treeview too much. just do as much you can in dark, and learn ways to do so while also utilizing fully custom views. maybe do js/wasm magic with dark.
