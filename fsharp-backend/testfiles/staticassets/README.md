# Static Assets Tests

These files are used for testing static assets. They were uploaded to the
`dark-static-assets` google cloud bucket for the canvas
`test-static-assets-deploy` (which hashes to `"u0n38z-mv-t0tkvnwiqyvankw6w"`).

They are directly accessible via HTTP at links such as
[https://test-static-assets-deploy.darksa.com/u0n38z-mv-t0tkvnwiqyvankw6w/abcdef1234/index.html]()

## Aside

The attempt to upload them via the dev static assets server using `dark-cli`
was not successful, so in the end I just figured out where they were being
uploaded and uploaded them manually. The dev static assets server doesn't work
because the authentication is against the production server (and in the future
we're going to lean in on that, so it won't be fixed).
