# Sunday Advisor Meeting: Empowering Builders with Darklang

## The Core Question

**"We have language + runtime + basic CLI. How do we empower someone to download Darklang and start building real software?"**

---

## Current State: The Builder's Dilemma

**What we have:**
- Functional language with solid runtime
- Basic CLI with package navigation  
- Matter architecture designed (content-addressable package management + source control)
- Foundation pieces that work

**What happens when someone downloads the CLI today:**
```bash
curl -sSL get.darklang.com | sh
dark --help                    # Shows basic commands
dark nav Darklang.Stdlib      # Can browse existing packages
# ... now what? How do I build something?
```

**The gap**: No clear path from "installed CLI" to "built and deployed software"

## The Target Builder Experience (2025 Vision)

### The Web App Builder Journey
```bash
# Discovery and setup (< 5 minutes)
curl -sSL get.darklang.com | sh
dark new webapp my-blog
cd my-blog
dark dev                       # Opens browser to running app + editor

# Development loop (feels like magic)
# Edit handlers/api.dark in VS Code
# See immediate changes in browser
# Every request shows up in trace viewer
# Errors are helpful with suggested fixes

# Adding functionality (minutes, not hours)
dark search "user authentication"
dark try Darklang.Auth.login          # Test it interactively first
dark import Darklang.Auth             # Add to project
dark generate handler "POST /login"   # Scaffold auth endpoint

# Deployment (single command)
dark deploy                    # Handles everything automatically
# → https://my-blog.darklang.io is live
```

### The CLI Tool Builder Journey
```bash
dark new cli file-processor
dark dev --watch              # Hot reload for CLI development
# Edit main.dark
dark test                     # Run tests continuously
dark build                    # Create standalone binary
dark publish                  # Share with community
```

### The Community Package Builder Journey
```bash
dark new lib email-utils
# Build reusable functions
dark test --coverage
dark docs generate            # Auto-generate docs from code
dark publish Acme.Email      # Share with community
dark stats                   # See adoption and usage
```

## The Technical Foundation: How Matter Enables This

### Content-Addressable Everything
- **Packages**: Hash-based, perfect for distribution/caching
- **Functions**: Individual versioning, no dependency hell
- **Projects**: Immutable snapshots, perfect rollback capability

### Sessions Instead of Branches
- Lightweight contexts for parallel development
- Perfect for AI-assisted development (each AI gets its own session)
- Natural collaboration without complex git workflows

### Immediate Feedback Loops
- Content hashes enable instant cache validation
- Traces tied to specific code versions
- Hot reload works perfectly with immutable content

---

## Implementation Roadmap: Builder-Centric

### Phase 1 (Next 2 Months): "Basic Builder Journey Works"

**Goal**: Web app builder can go from download → deployed app

**Core Commands Needed**:
```bash
dark new webapp <name>         # Project scaffolding
dark dev                       # Development server + hot reload
dark deploy                    # One-command deployment
dark search <query>            # Package discovery
dark import <package>          # Add functionality
```

**Technical Requirements**:
- Project templates and scaffolding system
- Development server with file watching
- Basic deployment pipeline (even if manual)
- Package search and import system
- Matter integration for session management

### Phase 2 (Months 3-4): "Feels Like Magic"

**Goal**: Development experience that's clearly better than alternatives

**Enhanced Commands**:
```bash
dark try <function>            # Interactive function testing
dark generate <pattern>        # Code generation
dark trace --live              # Real-time trace viewing
dark share                     # Instant work sharing
```

**Technical Requirements**:
- VS Code integration with trace viewing
- AI-assisted code generation
- Real-time collaboration features
- Advanced Matter conflict resolution

### Phase 3 (Months 5-6): "Community Ready"

**Goal**: External contributors can build and share packages easily

**Community Commands**:
```bash
dark publish <package>         # Share packages
dark fork <package>            # Create variations
dark stats                     # Usage analytics
dark contribute <suggestion>   # Suggest improvements
```

**Technical Requirements**:
- Package registry and distribution
- Documentation generation
- Usage analytics and discovery
- Community contribution workflows
