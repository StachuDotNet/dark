# Tomorrow's Coworker Meeting - Preparation

## Meeting Goal
Break through analysis paralysis and get concrete agreement on next steps for enabling basic code sharing between Ocean and Stachu.

## Key Message
**"The architecture is complete, now we need to build the implementation bridge to make it real."**

## What We've Accomplished Since Last Meeting

### ✅ Complete Foundation Ready
- **SCM Architecture**: Content-addressable with append-only content + mutable name pointers
- **Database Schema**: 7 tables designed and ready (package_content_v0, package_names_v0, patches_v0, etc.)
- **F# Types**: Complete Op taxonomy in ProgramTypes.fs (AddFunctionContent, UpdateNamePointer, CreatePatch, etc.)
- **CLI Infrastructure**: Basic command system ready for SCM extensions

### ✅ Design Documents Complete
- `scm_design_draft.md` - Complete architectural specification
- `implementation_plan.md` - Concrete 3-phase roadmap
- `LibSCM_draft.fs` - F# implementation sketch showing exactly what needs to be built

## The Core Insight

**Problem**: Classic Darklang had good immediate feedback but was trapped in a browser
**Solution**: Content-addressable SCM that separates "what code is" from "where code lives"

**Before**: `UpdateFunction(uuid, newDefinition)` - mutates in place
**After**: `AddFunctionContent(hash, definition)` + `UpdateNamePointer(location, newHash)`

**Benefits**:
- True immutability: every version preserved forever
- Perfect deduplication: same content = same hash  
- Easy moves/renames: just update name pointers
- Natural aliasing: multiple names → same content

## What's Missing (The Gap)

The architecture exists but **NO IMPLEMENTATION** of the SCM operations:

- ❌ No Op execution functions (types exist, no implementation)  
- ❌ No CLI SCM commands (`dark patch new`, `dark fn create`, etc.)
- ❌ No content hashing for functions
- ❌ No session management
- ❌ No sync protocol

## Proposed Solution: 3-Phase Implementation

### Phase 1 (Next 2 weeks): Minimal Viable SCM
**Goal**: Ocean and Stachu can share code via basic patches

**Deliverables**:
```bash
# These commands should work:
dark patch new "Add String.reverse function"
dark fn create Darklang.Stdlib.String reverse "Reverses a string"  
dark patch show
dark session new --name "my-work" 
dark sync push/pull  # Even if just file-based initially
```

**Implementation**: ~200 lines F# in LibSCM module + CLI command additions

### Phase 2 (Month 2): Enhanced Workflow  
**Goal**: Feels like "normal" development with session management

### Phase 3 (Months 3-4): Production Ready
**Goal**: Community-ready with VS Code integration

## Key Decisions Needed

1. **Where should Op execution live?** LibPackageManager vs separate LibSCM?
2. **Content hashing strategy?** SHA256 of serialized PT vs custom scheme?
3. **Initial sync approach?** File exchange vs basic HTTP vs something else?
4. **CLI vs F# implementation?** Some operations could be in Darklang itself

## Demo Plan

1. **Show the complete architecture** (5 min)
   - ProgramTypes.fs Op taxonomy
   - Database schema  
   - Design documents

2. **Show the gap analysis** (3 min)
   - Current CLI commands (nav, ls, view)
   - Missing SCM commands
   - Implementation drafts

3. **Propose Phase 1 plan** (7 min)
   - Concrete next steps
   - Timeline: 2 weeks to basic sharing
   - Key technical decisions needed

## Open Questions for Discussion

- Should we prioritize CLI-first or F#-first implementation?
- How important is VS Code integration for Phase 1?
- What's the simplest sync mechanism that would work for us?
- Should sessions be stored in DB or local files initially?

## Success Metrics

**By next meeting**: Ocean can create a function, generate patch, share with Stachu
**By week 2**: Stachu can apply Ocean's patch, modify it, share back
**By month 1**: Both working on different features simultaneously

---

**Bottom Line**: We have the blueprint. Now let's build the house.
