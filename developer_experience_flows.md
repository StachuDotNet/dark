# Darklang Developer Experience: Download CLI → Build Real Software

## The Central Question for Sunday's Meeting

**"We have language + runtime + basic CLI. How do we empower someone to download Darklang and start building real software?"**

Matter (our unified package manager + source control) is infrastructure. The question is: what developer experiences does it enable?

## Complete Developer Journey Flows

### Flow 1: "I want to build a web app" 

**Current Reality**: Person downloads CLI → ??? → frustration
**Target Experience**:

```bash
# Discovery & Setup
curl -sSL get.darklang.com | sh           # Install CLI
dark --help                               # See what's possible
dark examples list                        # Browse starter templates
dark new webapp my-blog --template simple-blog
cd my-blog

# Development Loop  
dark dev                                  # Start dev server with hot reload
# Opens editor, shows running app, traces, logs
# Edit handlers/api.dark in VS Code
# See immediate feedback in browser
# Traces show exactly what happened for each request

# Add functionality 
dark add auth                             # Add authentication system
dark add database posts                   # Add database with posts table
dark generate handler "GET /api/posts"    # Generate API endpoint
dark generate page "POST /admin/posts"    # Generate admin page

# Package Discovery
dark search "send email"                  # Find email packages
dark view Darklang.Email.send             # See function documentation
dark import Darklang.Email                # Add to project

# Testing & Debugging
dark test                                 # Run all tests
dark test --watch                         # Continuous testing
dark trace --filter "/api/posts"          # See traces for specific endpoint
dark logs --tail                          # Watch live logs

# Deployment
dark deploy                               # One-command deploy
dark status                               # Check deployment status
dark url                                  # Get live URL
```

### Flow 2: "I want to build a CLI tool"

```bash
dark new cli my-tool --template script
dark dev --watch                         # Hot reload for CLI development

# Edit logic
dark generate command "sync" --args "source target" 
dark test my-tool sync ./local ./remote

# Package as binary
dark build --target binary               # Create standalone executable
dark publish                             # Share with community
```

### Flow 3: "I want to contribute to/use community packages"

```bash
# Discovery
dark browse packages                     # Interactive package explorer  
dark search "json parsing"              # Search functionality
dark trending                            # See what's popular

# Usage
dark view Acme.JSON.parse               # See function docs, examples, traces
dark try Acme.JSON.parse                # Interactive REPL to test
dark import Acme.JSON                   # Add to current project

# Contributing  
dark fork Acme.JSON                     # Create your own version
dark contribute Acme.JSON "fix parsing bug"  # Suggest improvements
dark publish My.BetterJSON              # Share your improvements
```

### Flow 4: "I want to work with my team"

```bash
# Team setup
dark team create my-startup
dark team invite alice@startup.com
dark clone team://my-startup/main-app   # Get team's main project

# Feature development
dark session new "add-user-profiles"    # Create development session
dark sync                                # Get latest team changes
# ... develop feature ...
dark share                               # Share work-in-progress with team
dark merge                               # Merge when ready

# Code review
dark review alice/user-profiles         # Review teammate's work
dark comment "line 42: consider error handling"
dark approve alice/user-profiles

# Deployment coordination
dark deploy staging                     # Deploy to staging environment
dark deploy prod --require-approval    # Require team approval for production
```

### Flow 5: "I want to learn Darklang" 

```bash
# Interactive learning
dark tutorial start                     # Interactive tutorial in CLI
dark examples run "hello-world"        # Run examples locally
dark playground                        # Interactive REPL

# Documentation
dark docs Stdlib.List.map              # See function documentation
dark examples List.map                 # See usage examples
dark community                         # Connect with other learners

# Building understanding
dark explain "List.map fn list"        # AI explanation of code
dark trace --explain                   # Explain what traces mean
dark why "type error on line 23"       # Get help with errors
```

## What This Requires (Infrastructure & Implementation)

### Development Environment
- **Hot reload system**: File watching + instant feedback
- **Integrated trace viewer**: See execution for every request/command
- **Error system**: Helpful errors with suggestions and fixes
- **VS Code integration**: Syntax highlighting, autocomplete, debugging

### Package & Discovery System  
- **Package browser**: Visual, searchable interface (`dark browse packages`)
- **Smart search**: Find packages by functionality, not just name
- **Try-before-import**: Test packages interactively before adding
- **Usage analytics**: Show popular packages, trending functions

### Project Management
- **Templates & scaffolding**: `dark new` creates working projects instantly
- **Generators**: Auto-create common patterns (handlers, pages, tests)
- **Configuration**: Manage secrets, environment variables, deployment settings

### Collaboration (Matter-enabled)
- **Sessions**: Lightweight branching for feature development  
- **Sharing**: Easy work-in-progress sharing without formal "commits"
- **Merge workflows**: Handle conflicts gracefully with Matter's content-addressable system
- **Team coordination**: See what others are working on, coordinate deployments

### Deployment & Production
- **One-command deploy**: `dark deploy` handles everything
- **Multiple environments**: staging, production, preview branches
- **Monitoring**: Built-in observability, error tracking, performance monitoring
- **Rollback**: Instant rollback using Matter's immutable history

### Learning & Community
- **Interactive documentation**: Not just reference, but explorable examples
- **AI assistance**: Context-aware help and explanations
- **Community features**: Sharing, discovering, learning from others
- **Onboarding**: Smooth path from "never heard of Darklang" to "building real apps"

## Critical Gap Analysis

### What exists today:
- ✅ Language definition and runtime
- ✅ Basic CLI with package navigation
- ✅ Package manager foundation  
- ✅ Matter architecture (types and database schema)

### What's missing for "download CLI → build software":
- ❌ **Project scaffolding**: No `dark new` command
- ❌ **Development server**: No hot reload, no trace viewer
- ❌ **Package discovery**: Can view packages but can't search/browse easily
- ❌ **Generators**: No way to auto-create common patterns
- ❌ **Deployment**: No `dark deploy` capability
- ❌ **VS Code experience**: Basic extension vs full development environment
- ❌ **Community features**: No sharing, no discovery, no learning resources
- ❌ **Error experience**: Basic errors vs helpful guidance
- ❌ **Team workflows**: No collaboration beyond basic package sharing

## Sunday Meeting Focus Questions

1. **Priority**: Which developer experience flow should we nail first?
2. **Community**: How do we bootstrap the package ecosystem?
3. **Competition**: What makes this compelling vs existing tools?
4. **Resources**: What would it take to build the "download → build" experience?
5. **Timeline**: How fast can we get from current state to delightful developer experience?

**The goal**: By the end of 2025, someone can download Darklang CLI and build a real web app faster and with better experience than with any other tool.
