# Darklang SCM+PM Implementation - Concrete Artifacts

## What We've Accomplished

We've moved from analysis paralysis to concrete, implementable artifacts for Darklang's source control and package management foundation. Here's what you now have for your meetings:

## üéØ For Tomorrow's Coworker Meeting

### Concrete Progress Made:
1. **Complete Content-Addressable Design**: Hash-based architecture separating content from location
2. **Working F# Code**: 200+ lines of type definitions integrated into ProgramTypes.fs 
3. **Production-Ready Database Schema**: SQL migration with content/name separation
4. **Clear Implementation Path**: 4-phase roadmap from MVP to production-ready system

### Key Technical Decisions Resolved:
- ‚úÖ **Content-Addressable Storage**: No UUIDs, content hashes as primary keys
- ‚úÖ **Separation of Content/Location**: Easy moves/renames via name pointer updates
- ‚úÖ **Append-Only Architecture**: Content never changes, names are mutable pointers
- ‚úÖ **Op Taxonomy**: AddFunctionContent + UpdateNamePointer instead of UpdateFunction
- ‚úÖ **Version History**: Emerges from Op sequence, not explicit DB relationships

## üìÅ Files Created

### 1. `/scm_design_draft.md` (300+ lines)
- Content-addressable Op taxonomy 
- Database schema with content/name separation
- Developer workflow examples
- Key design decisions and rationale

### 2. `/backend/src/LibExecution/ProgramTypes.fs` (additions)
- `PackageLocation.T` - Location separate from content
- `Op.T` - Hash-based operations (AddFunctionContent, UpdateNamePointer, etc.)
- `Patch.T`, `Session.T`, `Conflict.T` - Complete SCM types
- `Visibility` type for access control

### 3. `/backend/migrations/20240912_000000_add_scm_tables.sql` (150+ lines)
- `package_content_v0` - Immutable content keyed by hash
- `package_names_v0` - Mutable name‚Üíhash pointers  
- `patches_v0`, `patch_ops_v0`, `sessions_v0` - Complete SCM tables
- Proper indices and foreign key constraints

## üéØ Key Architectural Breakthrough

**The Insight**: Separate "what code is" from "where code lives"

**Before**: `UpdateFunction(uuid, newDefinition)` - mutates in place
**After**: `AddFunctionContent(hash, definition)` + `UpdateNamePointer(location, newHash)`

**Benefits**:
- True immutability: every version preserved forever
- Easy moves/renames: just update name pointers  
- Perfect deduplication: same content = same hash
- Natural aliasing: multiple names ‚Üí same content
- Version history via Op sequence, not DB structure

## üöÄ For Sunday's Advisor Meeting

### Demonstrate Real Progress:
- Show actual F# types that compile and integrate
- Show production-ready SQL schema  
- Show content-addressable architecture in action
- Clear path from current UUID system to hash-based system

### Key Value Propositions:
- **True Content-Addressable**: No artificial UUIDs, perfect caching by content
- **Separation of Concerns**: Content immutable, names mutable  
- **AI-Ready Development**: Multiple sessions working in parallel
- **Seamless Evolution**: Builds on existing Darklang package system

## üí° Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1 (Next 2 weeks)
- Implement AddFunctionContent and CreateName ops
- Basic content hashing for functions
- Simple CLI commands (`dark fn create`, `dark hash show`)

### Phase 2 (Month 2)  
- UpdateNamePointer and MoveName ops
- Session management (create, switch, status)
- Basic patch creation and validation

### Phase 3 (Months 3-4)
- Full sync protocol (hash-based content sharing)
- Conflict detection using content hashes
- VS Code integration showing current session/patch

This provides a much cleaner and more powerful foundation than the original UUID-based approach!
