/// The two blob builtins that touch the package STORE: promote an ephemeral blob
/// into `package_blobs`, and get a persistent ref back from a hash.
///
/// The pure blob builtins (`Builtins.Pure.Libs.Blob`) never write the store and
/// never need to find a row by hash: an ephemeral blob carries its bytes, and a
/// persistent one is only ever handed to code by something that already read the
/// row. These two are what lets Dark code MAKE a persistent blob and NAME one, which
/// a generator needs: its input file is stored once, and the saved generator refers
/// to it by hash.
